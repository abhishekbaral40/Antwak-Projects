2.What would happen if you disable the HBase table?
Solution: After disabling the table, we can still sense its existence through list and exists commands. We cannot scan it. It will give the following error.

hbase(main)> scan '<table_name>'
ROW         COLUMN + CELL
ERROR: <table_name> is disabled.

3.What would happen if you drop the Hive integration table?
Solution: We cannot scan or list the table. It gets removed from the database 
hbase(main):007:0> scan "<table_name>"
ROW                      COLUMN+CELL                                                        

ERROR: Unknown table <table_name>!


4.What performance improvement did you observe when using the HBase table vs Hive table? (In terms of query response)
